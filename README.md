# Java-with-Python-Spacing
This is really bad, but essentially takes a file and places brackets around where the indentation changes to emulate Python. Should work in most programming languages, not just Java. Also, it will do this for EVERY indentation change, so long as the line isn't pure whitespace. So there is no formatting you can do with your code that changes the indentation or it won't work. By the way, the output is NOT going to be formatted well, so the brackets will have no indentation.

To run without the batch file use `java -jar JavaWithPythonSpacing.jar [source file] [destination file]`
And with use `run.bat [source file] [destination file]`
